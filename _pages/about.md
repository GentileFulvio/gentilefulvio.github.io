Hi! I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable, cloud-native solutions. With experience in the healthcare sector, I’ve seen firsthand how technology can drive meaningful change, and I love using serverless architectures on AWS to solve complex challenges.

Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring and coaching others in their tech journeys—but writing clean, efficient code will always be my first love. Whether it’s designing resilient architectures or optimizing cloud infrastructure, I thrive on turning challenges into elegant solutions.

When I’m not deep in code, you’ll find me exploring the latest in cloud technology or sharing knowledge with fellow developers. Let’s connect and build something amazing!
